# README-Generator
## Description

This project prompts the user for information about their current project and then creates a professional README.md file with that input.

## Usage

In the command terminal type in node index.js to start the program. Answer each prompt with as much detail as you would like their to be in your README file. Once all the prompts have been filled in a new README.md will be created using your inputed information.
